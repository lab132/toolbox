About the ezEngine Project {#AboutEZ}
==========================

The ezEngine project is a spare time project of a few guys from the games industry with the goal of having flexible, reusable and performant libraries built in a portable way for experimentation at home or for other projects. The main design choices were made for applications in the realtime space (e.g. games), however the libraries are meant to be flexible to use so they should be able to provide a benefit in many C++ applications.
