Everyone who makes projects that he likes to share, can put them here.
Otherwise he should put them outside the repository.

There are cmake files to easily generate application solutions, however you are not required to use the build system for these projects.

Be aware, that you give up ownership of everything that you commit into this repository. So if you are working on something that you want to keep to your own, you must commit that elsewhere.
